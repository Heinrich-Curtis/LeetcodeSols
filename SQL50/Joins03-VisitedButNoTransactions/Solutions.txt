# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT VISITS.customer_id, COUNT(VISITS.visit_id) AS count_no_trans 
from Visits 
LEFT JOIN Transactions 
ON VISITS.visit_id = TRANSACTIONS.visit_id  
WHERE TRANSACTIONS.amount IS NULL 
GROUP BY VISITS.customer_id;

What's going on here: We want to find all the customers who visited but did not make a transaction, and we want to know how often they did that. So we want a count of every visit that doesn't have a transaction associated with it, grouped by the customer who made the visit.
