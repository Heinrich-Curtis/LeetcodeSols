# Write your MySQL query statement below
select EmployeeUNI.unique_id,Employees.name from Employees left join EmployeeUNI on Employees.id = EmployeeUNI.id;

#couple things going on here: use of each table name to identify unique rows, use of left join to say
"select all the records from Employee UNI that match records in Employees based on the id that's shared
between them". I guess the "null" value just comes for free with MySQL.
